# EcoBici Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes EcoBici bike-sharing data to gain insights into user behavior and trip patterns.

## Project Structure
- `data.csv`: The dataset containing EcoBici trip records.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing data analysis code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  - Visualizations of trip duration, station usage, and user demographics.
- Calculated metrics:
  - Average trip duration.
  - Most used stations.
  - Relationships between gender and age of users.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb`

## Results
- The average trip duration is calculated to be approximately X minutes.
- The most used stations are identified along with their usage patterns.
- Relationships between gender and age of users are explored using visualizations and statistical analysis.
